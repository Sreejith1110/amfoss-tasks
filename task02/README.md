# explaination about task 02
## part 0 <br>
 I cloned the git repository 'Terminal chaos' into my system using 'git clone' command and created two directories named task 02 and handbook using 'mkdir command'. then i entered the repository and opened the directory named 'Arrakis-dex' using 'cd' command
## part 1 <br>
 I listed the files and directories in the 'Arrakis-dex' directory using 'ls' command in which i went into the 'Eolian caves' in which i used 'find' command to find the 'parchment.txt' file.  I navigated through it to 'parchment' file  then i opened the file using the 'cat' command. After i got the code i pushed it into the handbook using 'nano','git add','git commit -m' and 'git push origin main' commands.
## part 2 <br>
 I then went to the 'the light realm' through the 'git checkout' command where i searched for the files containing 'good' and 'holy' using the 'grep -r -e "holy" -e "good" *' command which displayed the file content along with the path of directory, finding the files and decoded the code of holy spell. Then i went through many directories eventually finding the 'Kharnok the Bloodforged.py' file executed it using the 'python3' command then beating it with the holy spell code, unlocking the dark realm
## part 3 <br>
 I entered the 'dark realm' using the 'git checkout' command then using cat on the 'celestial veil amulet' and 'lightbook' files obtaining the codes and pushing it into the handbook. then i returned to the entrance and used tree to locate the chest1.py. after navigating there i opened the file using 'python3' command then used the 'celestial veil amulet' code to unlock the 'darkbook I.txt' geting the code which i pushed into the handbook using 'nano'. Then went to the 'dark realm II' using the 'git checkout' command then opening the 'chest2.py' using the same code used to open chest1 then appended the code into the handbook using 'nano'.
## part 4 <br>
 I used the parchment code,lightbook code,darkbook I and darkbook II in the respective order and decoded it using the 'base64 -d <<<"code" to get link to the godsuite repository which i cloned into my system .
## part 5 <br>
 I used the git log ,where i got the hash code of each commit named first stage of godsuite,......,fourth stage of godsuite. I used git checkout on each of them finding the last code which i run in the divine machine called 'Voidgate.sh' which i opened using the 'sh' command. After decoding the code i got the link to the 'to-the-stars-and-realms-unseen' repository in which i opened the 'victory.py' using the 'python3 victory.py --run' command then took a screenshot of the message in it and pushed it into the handbook.--- task02 completed ---
