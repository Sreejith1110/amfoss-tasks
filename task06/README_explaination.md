# Explaination on task 6
The Task was about flutter ecommerce app which is a open source repository in github. I did the documentation by googling the code in the lib directory which i explained in the documentation.md . The directory structure was done using ``tree -L 5 > DirectoryStructure.md``. The README.md was also done using the support of google for setting up the application.<br>
